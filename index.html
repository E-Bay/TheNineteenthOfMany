<h1>My Cause</h1>
    <p>One huge misconception about my cause (that being how violence in video games is portrayed) is that all video games with any sort of violence is what is making <b>children</b> more violent.</p>
<h1>Clearing the Misconception</h1>
    <p>From the reading, it was brought up that human's are often mistaken. The way they described these were as a sort of "Bug." A total of three bugs to be exact, The Patternicity Bug, The Storytelling Bug, and The Confirmation Bug. These ideas are the prime example of why it is such a huge misconception that <b>ALL</b> violence in <b>ALL</b> video games lead to violent children. First, the Patternicity Bug is described as an "astonishing capacity for detecting patterns." However it fails to notice if something is of "pure coincidence" or is just "noise." For the misconception I stated earlier, it is said to be a fact that violence in video games are what is making the kids violent, however these fail to think of these as coincidental or a background detail. Similar to the idea of correlation being causation. The next bug was the Stroytelling Bug, this bug occurs after noticing a pattern and strives us to "find a cause-effect explanation." This is also why people stereotype and generalize information, similarly with video game violence. People think that just because a video game has violence they associate it with other violent games, saying how it will cause people to do one thing or ,as some parents may even say, cause someone to do drastic things. The last bug mentioned was the Confirmation Bug. The confirmation bug is something people do everyday, that being searching for information that backs up their own theory. For how violence is caused by video games for example, someone would just google something along the lines of "Violent video games cause violence article" in order to prove their own facts about this, we students even do these things occasionally for papers, projects, etc. These three things from the reading help explain why people have unnecessary reasonings and outrageous thoughts.</p>
